						all branches don't differ beyond a height of 1, so I think it's balanced.
						but, it seems we would want to get something like this:
						
						
										5
								4				9
							2				6		7
						1		3		
						
						No. I guess that's the same. Now the left branch is higher by 1 instead of the right branch.
